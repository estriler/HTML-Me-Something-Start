            <h1>Overview</h1>
               <p>
                  I have always had an interest in video games: how they work, why they are fun, why they can be so addictive. 
                  As I've learned to code, I have gained a better understanding of how video games are formulated.
                  This got my creative gears turning.
                  <br><br>
                  The overall plot of the game is to run a successful candy store, possibly the most successful candy store. 
                  Every in-game day, you will have your character buy inventory, stock your shelves, open the store, and checkout customers as they arrive.

            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
               <p>
                  <h3>Super Market Simulator</h3>
                  <div id="image"><img src="images/Super Market Simulator Box Art.jpg"><br></div>
                  
                  This has been my latest obsession over the last few weeks and overall the biggest inpiration for my Candy Store Simulator idea. 
                  I found it very relaxing to buy a box of virtual inventory, have the package delivered to your store, open it up, and place the contents on a shelf.  
                  I don't know the psychology behind it, all I know is that it feeds the dopamine machine something fearce.
                  Maybe it's my interest in organization that really makes this game appeal to me.

                  <h3>Stardew Valley</h3>
                  <div id="image"><img src="images/Stardew Valley Box Art.jpg"><br></div>
                  I'm more inspired by the art style and asthetics of Stardew Valley that the actual game mechanics of it.
                  The pixel graphics and pleasing sound effects are going to be a crutial part of my Candy Story Simulator game.

                  <h3>Dave the Diver</h3>
                  <div id="image"><img src="images/Dave the Diver Box Art.jpg"><br></div>
                  Dave the Diver is a big inspiration gameplay-wise. The end of the day when you open up your sushi shop is very much how I see most of the Candy Store Simulator being. 
                  Needing the greet customers, do little mini games for them depending on what they want, getting tips depending on how well you do, etc.
