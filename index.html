                  <h3>Super Market Simulator</h3>
                  <img src="images/Super Market Simulator Box Art.jpg"><br>
                  This has been my latest obsession over the last few weeks and overall the biggest inpiration for my Candy Store Simulator idea. 
                  I found it very relaxing to buy a box of virtual inventory, recieve that box in the game, open it up, and place the contents on a shelf.  
                  I don't know the psychology behind it, all I know is that it feeds the dopamine machine something fearce.

                  <h3>Stardew Valley</h3>

                  I'm more inspired by the art style and asthetics of Stardew Valley that the actual game mechanics of it.
                  The pixel graphics and pleasing sound effects are going to be a crutial part of my Candy Story Simulator game.
