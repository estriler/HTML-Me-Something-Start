            <h1>Overview</h1>
               <p>
                  I have always had an interest in video games: how they work, why they are fun, why they can be so addictive. 
                  When I started to learn to code, I began to have a better idea on how games work.
                  This got my creative gears turning.
                  <br><br>
                  The overall plot of the game is to run a successful candy store.

            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
               <p>
                  <h3>Super Market Simulator</h3>
                  <img src="images/Super Market Simulator Box Art.jpg"><br>
                  This has been my latest obsession over the last few weeks and overall the biggest inpiration for my Candy Store Simulator idea. 
                  I found it very relaxing to buy a box of virtual inventory, recieve that box in the game, open it up, and place the contents on a shelf.  
                  I don't know the psychology behind it, all I know is that it feeds the dopamine machine something fearce.

                  <h3>Stardew Valley</h3>
                  <img src="images/Stardew Valley Box Art.jpg"><br>
                  I'm more inspired by the art style and asthetics of Stardew Valley that the actual game mechanics of it.
                  The pixel graphics and pleasing sound effects are going to be a crutial part of my Candy Story Simulator game.

                  <h3>Dave the Diver</h3>
                  <img src="images/Dave the Diver Box Art.jpg"><br>
                  Dave the Diver is a big inspiration gameplay-wise. The sushi shop part of the game is very much how I see most of the game being. 
                  Needing the greet customers, do little mini games for them depening on what they want, getting tips depending on how well you do, etc.
