            <h1>Overview</h1>
               <p class="funParagraph">
                  I have always had an interest in video games: how they work, why they are fun, why they can be so addictive. 
                  As I've learned to code, I have gained a better understanding of how video games are formulated.
                  This got my creative gears turning and has inspired me to make my own videogame.
                  <br><br>
                  The overall plot of the game is to run a successful candy store, possibly the most successful candy store. 
                  Every in-game day, you will have your character buy inventory, stock your shelves, open the store, and checkout customers as they arrive, and close up shop before the next day.
                  Rinse and repeat until you have made all the money.

            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
               <h3>Super Market Simulator</h3>
               <div class="image"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2670630/Supermarket_Simulator/"><img src="images/Super Market Simulator Box Art.jpg" alt="Super Market Simulator Box Art"></a><br></div>
               <p>
                  This has been my latest obsession over the last few weeks and overall the biggest inpiration for my Candy Store Simulator idea. 
                  I found it very relaxing to buy a box of virtual inventory, have the package delivered to your store, open it up, and place the contents on a shelf.  
                  I don't know the psychology behind it, all I know is that it feeds the dopamine machine something fierce and I want to replicate it as best I can in my game. 
               </p>
               <h3>Stardew Valley</h3>
               <div class="image"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/"><img src="images/Stardew Valley Box Art.jpg" alt="Stardew Valley Box Art"></a><br></div>
               <p>
                  I'm more inspired by the art style and asthetics of Stardew Valley that the actual game mechanics of it.
                  The pixel graphics and pleasing sound effects are going to be a crutial part of my Candy Story Simulator game.
                  I also like the idea of my game having a calander system to break up the repitition each day might bring.
               </p>
               <h3>Dave the Diver</h3>
               <div class="image"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1868140/DAVE_THE_DIVER/"><img src="images/Dave the Diver Box Art.jpg" alt="Dave the Diver Box Art"></a><br></div>
               <p>
                  Dave the Diver is a big inspiration gameplay-wise. The end of the day when you open up your sushi shop is very much how I see most of the Candy Store Simulator being. 
                  Needing the greet customers, do little mini games for them depending on what they want, getting tips depending on how well you do, etc.
                  I also really like how this is done on a 2 demensional field.
               </p>
               <h3>Overcooked!</h3>
               <div class="image"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1243830/Overcooked_All_You_Can_Eat/"><img src="/images/Overcooked! Box Art.jpg" alt="Overcooked! Box Art"></a></div>
               <p>
                  I really like the pacing of each level of Overcooked!, but not so much the stress that comes with it. 
                  I picture my Candy Store Simulator game being a lot more chill.
                  Rather than flat out failing a day, you maybe just don't quite make as much money as you would if you did better.
                  I want to reward players for playing well rather than punishing them for playing poorly.
